##### Pokedex-cli

You will need to get the database loaded from:

https://github.com/veekun/pokedex  

Follow their instructions to install and load the database.

Once you have gotten to the point after running ```pokedex load``` in 
their directory, you can run this command line interface using:

```python dex.py```

You can look up by name or number. Also, you can type ```natures``` or 
```characteristics / chars```, or even ```effort``` then it will prompt 
you for a stat to reverse-lookup E.V. training data.
